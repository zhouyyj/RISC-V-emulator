Optional: Use the gen_elfh script

3. Start the emulator program



4. User Interface

5. Environment Calls and Breakpoints    /    Guest Program I/O



Manipulate Input Devices(Switches, Keys)
Keys
1. Press key 1 to perform "step" function
2. Press key 2 to stop the program, press again to continue. 
When the example program asks for inputting number, it acts as confirm button.
3. Press key 4 to restart the program
